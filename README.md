The project files to accompany the book: The Monster Fun Book of Patterns for Developing Virtual Reality Applications

A PDF copy of the book is included as part of this repository. Anyone wanting a printed copy can use the link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1729142400. An eBook version is also available at: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MVVYJNL/. 

Error messages produced using Unity software with this project are because the current version does not include the SteamVR files. These can be downloaded from the Unity store. Alternatively, deleting examples 26, 27 and 28 should allow the remaining examples to be used.
